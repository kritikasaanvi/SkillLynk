SKILL-LYNK

please note that this is just 25% code of our whole project.

GOAL AND VISION:

The goal of our project is to develop a platform that is centered on small-scale workers and it resembles with  LinkedIn. 
The major goal is to use an easy-to-use mobile app to match skilled workers such as laborers, housekeepers, plumbers, electricians, and others with possible employers. 
On our app, people will be able to make their profiles with details about their availability, experience, and skills every thing related to their work. We will integrate blockchain technology into our payment system to guarantee secure transactions. 

FEATURES:

We will try to include as many languages as possible (prioritizing Hindi) in our project so that small-scale workers can understand our site better and get the most out of it. 

Escrow feature for safe payment and prevention of fraud.
